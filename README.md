# 2911-Calc
Calculator Project for 2911 Winter 2021

This is our Agile Development 2911 Project for the Winter 2021
Semester. We're attempting to create something of a practical
calculator that not only includes basic math functions, but
also has easy practical uses for day to day life. These functions
include accessible tasks like easy tax calculation, tip calculation,
currency exchange through simpler, user-friendly interactions.
